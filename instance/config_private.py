This file is for private config variables, like passwords or keys.

This file has not been added to .gitignore, because you should include a dummy version of your config
variables in the repository, so everyone can see which variables needs to be defined.

However, before adding any real values, use:
    git update-index --assume-unchanged config/production/config_private.py
to ensure that git doesn't add any private information to the repo
(see http://blog.pagebakers.nl/2009/01/29/git-ignoring-changes-in-tracked-files/).
