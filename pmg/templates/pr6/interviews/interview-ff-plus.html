    <p><strong>What challenges does your party face in terms of competing with larger, more established parties, and how
            do you overcome these challenges?</strong></p>
    <p>The Freedom Front Plus has a focused approach to the interests of minorities and the accommodation of cultural
        diversity in the current multinational state. That focus dictates to a certain measure the questions we attend
        to and sometimes there is very little competition in those areas.
        Our most important mechanism of competition is a highly developed work ethic. Each of our members covers several
        departments and puts in the extra effort to do so.</p>
    <p>In addition, we do not regard all other parties as competition. There are parties with a mandate from their
        voters which is different than ours, yet we share some values and interests. It is easy to co-operate with such
        parties and individual members. Even those parties with which we share very little, are approached with an
        attempt to understand, even when we oppose. </p>
    <p><strong>Can you share examples of successful collaborations or partnerships your party has formed with other
            parties to advance common goals or address shared concerns?</strong></p>
    <p>The FF Plus is not a member of the Portfolio Committee on Basic Education. However, we continuously liaised with
        the ACDP, which is. </p>
    <p>Regarding the Basic Education Laws Amendment Bill, we met with both the ACDP and DA, to align responses. </p>
    <p>In my own committee, the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Innovation, I simply tried to
        create a good understanding with all Members. That led to some success in matters regarding NSFAS and around the
        Square Kilometre Array.</p>


    <p>This is a question in which our whips did most of the work and I just respond from my personal involvement. </p>
    <p><strong>There has been criticism that parliamentary administrations are becoming more partisan and losing the
            unique cooperation among party benches seen in the earlier parliaments - is this true?</strong></p>
    <p>As the Sixth Parliament is the first I am part of, and since I did not follow Parliament closely before becoming
        an MP, I am not equipped for a well-considered response.</p>
    <p><strong>Tell us more about how Parliament supports smaller parties. is this support adequate and if not, what
            more could be done? </strong></p>





    <p>The parliamentary staff are extremely helpful. Committee secretaries and researchers with whom I worked
        maintained a high level of non-partisan assistance. I was especially dependent on these staff members with the
        Portfolio Committees on Basic Education, and Mineral Resources and Energy, where I am not a member. For these
        staff members, I have only the highest regard, as they supported me in several ways, without really knowing me.
    </p>


    <p>I got to know the staff at the Portfolio Committee on Higher Education, Science and Innovation well enough to
        develop a very good acquaintance. These people are marvellous and create trust in the institution.</p>


    <p>Chamber staff members were always professional and helpful.</p>


    <p>My contact with management is limited and I cannot comment on them.</p>


    <p><strong>What advice would you give to other emerging small parties or independent candidates looking to impact
            parliamentary politics?</strong></p>
    One should not overestimate the importance of an MP – although one should of course also not underestimate it. The
    important thing is that a blown-up perception of own importance may cause a demanding attitude towards staff –
    people on whom one largely depends.
    In addition, one should like reading, because Parliament is a printing factory.

    <p><strong>Can you share any memorable moments or experiences that stood out to you in the Sixth
            Parliament?</strong></p>
    <p>The camaraderie amongst MPs during extremely long sittings where everyone tries to record their vote in a
        language not their mother tongue made the hours bearable (and quite funny) and shows the true spirit of South
        Africans. The oversight visits to some of the most remote places in South Africa and the people of these places,
        will always stand out clearly in my mind. What an adventure!


    <p><strong>What are the greatest frustrations you have faced in the Sixth Parliament?</strong></p>
    <p>One of my greatest frustrations is having ministers not answer questions put to them or their blame shifting the
        problems to someone else.</p>


    <p><strong>How did you engage with your constituents during this term, and what efforts did you make to stay
            connected with their needs and opinions?</strong></p>
    <p>It is important to continually be present in your constituency... To regularly attend events/functions hosted by
        the community, to engage on a one-on-one basis with constituents, to be active on community forums and to always
        ask pertinent questions –
        these are just some mechanisms to stay abreast of what is happening in your constituency.</p>


    <p><strong>What advice would you give incoming MPs about effectively navigating the parliamentary environment and
            serving their constituents?</strong></p>
    <p>Never overpromise and underdeliver. Always speak truthfully.</p>


    <p><strong>In what ways did you collaborate with colleagues from different parties or political affiliations to
            achieve common goals</strong></p>
    <p>It is always good to continually discuss ideas and policy with colleagues. You gain an understanding of different
        communities, can find common issues and having a united front across party lines can address issues better.</p>


    <p><strong>How can Parliament build up public trust in the institution?</strong></p>
    <p>It starts with being an institution that sticks to rules, does not let bad behaviour slide, and ensures that the
        House is not degraded and turned into a circus of chaos. Also, decisions that are made should be followed
        through.</p>


    <p><strong>Areas of reform for the Seventh Parliament.</strong></p>
    <p>Better planning and thought needs to go into programmes, specifically taking oversight and study tours into
        account. It does not assist parliament or the people if thorough follow-up cannot be made.</p>


    <p><strong>How has your life changed since becoming a Member of Parliament?</strong></p>
    <p>Your life is not your own. You become the poster for your political party and need to act accordingly. A greater
        burden rests on your shoulders to truly represent your constituents and not let them down.</p>


    <p><strong>What does the future hold?</strong></p>
    <p>Hopefully, many more years of serving the people of South Africa.</p>
