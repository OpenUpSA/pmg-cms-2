Detect, identify, and resolve operational issues across your applications and infrastructure
OpenSearch platform for observability applications hero banner.
OpenSearch offers developers, IT administrators, site reliability engineers, and DevOps teams a comprehensive open-source observability solution that is cost conscious and highly scalable. You can use OpenSearch observability tools to detect, diagnose, and remedy issues that affect the performance, scalability, or availability of your software or infrastructure. A common open-standards-based schema coupled with a Piped Processing Language (PPL) optimized for observability use cases simplifies correlation and analysis of logs, metrics, and trace telemetry to support fast time to resolution and a better experience for your end users.
