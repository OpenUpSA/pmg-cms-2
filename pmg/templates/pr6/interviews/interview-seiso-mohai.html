    <p class="interview-q"><strong>The Most Significant Achievements of my Party</strong></p>

    <p>As the question correctly spells out, the South African parliament is a multi-party parliamentary system. The ANC is the majority party in parliament which gives it a strategic advantage in terms of setting the agenda of parliament and ensuring the strategic coherence of its members around the agreed party’s policy priorities.</p>
    <p>What distinguishes the South African parliament as a single party-dominated parliament from many parliaments in the world is the constitutional obligation imposed on parliament as an institution to oversee the executive and hold it accountable as opposed to relegating this function and power to the opposition. The ANC as a majority party has and continues to play a critical role in setting the agenda of parliament.</p>
    <p>In assessing the successes and challenges of parliament, this should proceed from the appreciation of its role and powers as articulated in the Constitution, namely: (1) representing the people to ensure government of the people by the people, (2) passing laws, (3) overseeing and scrutinizing the executive, (4) facilitating public involvement and (5) international participation and cooperation.</p>
    <p>The Constitution sets out the norms and standards that should guide parliament in fulfilling these functions consistent with democratic values and principles. Critical among these is the principle of majority rule where there is no consensus on issues. As common knowledge in the public domain, the period beginning 2014 during the 5th Parliament witnessed a creeping in of an undemocratic tendency whereby some sections of the minority parties sought to impose their views on the majority through disruptive and violent behaviour.</p>
    <p>There was nothing in the parliamentary rules on how to deal with this situation, which sometimes stalled parliamentary proceedings. To avoid disruptive and violent countermeasures by the majority, the ANC has through the persuasion of other political parties strengthened the parliamentary rules and code of conduct as a democratic way of addressing this challenge.</p>
    <p>As a result of this, the 2024 State of the Nation Address and the subsequent debates were held without a single disruption. This was prefaced with the suspension or sanctioning of several disruptive Members, especially the members of the EFF. Key among these sanctions was suspension without pay for a specified period. The attempts by the affected members and the EFF to challenge this in the High Court could not succeed thus confirming the legality of the adopted remedies and sanctions in the Rules. Fundamental to the success of this is the reclaiming of the decorum and democratic credentials of parliament where there should be a free flow of ideas without fear or favor.</p>
    <p>The Sixth Parliament witnessed the intensified contact of the parliamentary committees with key non-state actors and the broader public to assess, among other things, the impact of policy and the challenges of service delivery.</p>
    <p>The parliamentary inquiry into the sale of South African Airways and the inquiry into the challenges of governance at the University of Cape Town and other universities were led by the ANC and demonstrate key successes of the 6th Parliament.</p>
    <p>Parliament has passed significant ground-breaking transformative legislation and resolutions during the period under review. Noteworthy amongst these is the hotly contested National Health Insurance Bill, the General Intelligence Laws Amendment Bill, the impeachment of the former Public Protector as well as two sitting Judges of the High Court with the support of most political parties.</p>
    <p>Parliament oversight work was taken to new heights during the period under review. Critical among the milestones was the consideration of the Zondo Commission recommendations with inquiries conducted against affected members with most of them given serious sanction. Some recommendations of the Commission of Inquiry into State Capture are complex and unprecedented in the global context hence parliament is undertaking studies on some of these, which include an oversight committee over the Presidency.</p>
    <p>The building of institutional capacity to position parliament at the cutting edge of democratic consolidation has been an ongoing concern for parliament for many years. The ANC has played a critical role in the conceptualization and benchmarking of the South African Parliamentary Institute as a key intervention to accomplish this. This is a capacity building and resource support for MPs across political parties to enable them to execute their mandate effectively.</p>

    <p class="interview-q"><strong>Major Challenges and the Role of the Chief Whip’s Office</strong></p>

    <p>The period leading to the 54th ANC national conference at NASREC in 2022 with the suspension of the former ANC Secretary General, and thereafter, was accompanied by the resurgence of factionalism in the ANC which reared its head in the ANC Parliamentary Caucus. At the core of this factionalism were orchestrated attempts to undermine the leadership and authority of President Ramaphosa and those seen to be loyal to him.</p>
    <p>As a manifestation of this, attempts were made by some members of the ANC Caucus to lay frivolous criminal charges against the President and the Chief Whip of the Majority Party in the National Assembly, and the defiance of the party line on critical positions collectively agreed on by the party. These members were identified, reprimanded and some even suspended from the Caucus by the Chief Whip’s Office. The decisive and speedy intervention of the Chief Whip’s Office restored party unity, discipline and strategic cohesion.</p>
    <p>The party loyalty–public interest nexus continues to dominate media discourse. At the core of this discourse is a false narrative about the ANC subordinating the public interest for its own narrow partisan interests, especially as it relates to corruption allegations against its members. This cannot be corroborated by facts as the ANC has its own internal process for addressing such issues and has demonstrated beyond doubt its consistency on zero tolerance of corruption.</p>
    <p>The ANC is the only party in South Africa that has recalled many of its cadres based on the allegations of corruption, only to the extent that such allegations are proven and tested. It has recalled its own President based on such allegations on its own terms.</p>

    <p class="interview-q"><strong>The Abiding Successes and Lessons for Other Parties</strong></p>

    <p>For Parliament to adopt certain resolutions and legislation requires a two-third majority which the ANC does not command on its own. Had it not been due to the persuasive capabilities of the ANC Caucus to appeal to other parties’ conscience not to elevate narrow partisan interests above the interests of the country, parliament could have not appointed heads of key institutions like the Public Protector and the Inspector General of Intelligence, let alone pass the resolution on the impeachment of the judges and the Public Protector.</p>
    <p>This is borne out of the ANC's strategic gravitas to engage other political parties bilaterally and jointly outside formal parliamentary processes, the art which many political parties, if not most, cannot master.</p>
    <p>The global outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the functionality of society economically, socially and politically, including the ability of government to function effectively and efficiently. In response to this, the South African parliament speedily leveraged digital and information communication technology capabilities as a new normal to ensure the continuity of parliamentary work.</p>
    <p>This included the use of technology to conduct virtual meetings with every member and official sitting in the comfort of his/her own private residence. Among the benefits and abiding lessons of virtual meetings are the cutting down of travelling and accommodation costs associated with physical meetings.</p>

    <p class="interview-q"><strong>The Party’s Framework for Constituency Work </strong></p>

    <p>Constituency work and offices constitute a critical platform for MPs as public representatives to continually interface with their constituencies by intervening on critical issues that affect their constituencies through referral to the relevant competent authorities. The ANC approach to constituency offices is the allocation of these offices, MPs and MPLs to each district in all provinces.</p>
    <p>Each office is staffed by one constituency administrator and coordinator with the former focusing on physical walk-ins at the office and overall administration of the office and the latter doing community outreach, liaison and data gathering around service challenges in the communities within the district.</p>

    <p class="interview-q"><strong>Synopsis of the Strategic Priorities for the 7th Parliament</strong></p>

    <p>The strategic priorities of the 7th Parliament will be predicated on the electoral mandate of the majority party as a normal practice which will find translation into the Medium-Term Strategic Framework. Whatever the political party that will emerge as the majority party, there are however certain key national strategic priorities and projects that should find automatic expression in the MTSF as an expression of the dialectic of change and continuity.</p>
    <p>If the ANC wins the coming elections with a sufficient majority, the six key priorities identified in its 2024 election manifesto will constitute the touchstone of the MTSF around which parliamentary oversight, law-making, the facilitation of public involvement and international participation and cooperation.</p>

    <p class="interview-q"><strong>Summary and Conclusion</strong></p>

    <p>The transformative role of parliament as a central institution of democracy is one of the most under-researched and poorly theorized in both academic and policy research.<sup data-fn="1">1</sup> As noted by the Inter-Parliamentary Union, this has become more glaring within the evolving global context of the deepening crisis of democracy and its institutions.<sup data-fn="2">2</sup></p>
    <p>At the core of the poor conceptualization of the role of parliament is the tendency to conflate its role with that of the executive, and at times, with that of the judiciary.  As a result, there arises a tendency to blame parliament for the failures of the executive or the judiciary. This calls for deliberate act by the 7th Parliament to sponsor post-graduate studies to doctoral level on parliamentary studies.</p>
    <p>This will go a long way towards generating the new body of knowledge based on the past and the present about the positioning of parliament at the beachhead of democratic renewal and consolidation.</p>
    <p>In conclusion, it is worth noting that the ANC has lost some serious battles in Parliament, some out of its own subjective strategic choices, whilst others because of the lack of a two-thirds majority and the ganging up of the opposition against it. The failure to amend section 25 of the Constitution to fast track the expropriation of land without compensation is among these glaring setbacks.</p>
