    <p><strong>What challenges does your party face in competing with larger, more established parties, and how do you overcome these challenges?</strong></p>
    <p>The biggest challenge is that bigger parties can sit in various parliamentary committees, and that way they're able to interact and engage on different issues that are affecting society. However, smaller parties such as the ATM do not have the luxury of being able to be in different committee meetings at the same time. So we try to manage and mitigate this challenge by taking on additional work, because on average, an MP is a member of maybe one or two portfolio committees, but for us MPs from smaller parties, we can be full-time members of say four or five different portfolio committees and alternate members of a few other committees. These committees can meet simultaneously such that one has to manage one’s time effectively to deal with this challenge. </p>
    <p><strong>Can you share examples of successful collaborations or partnerships your party has formed with other parties to advance common goals or address shared concerns?</strong></p>
    <p>Perhaps the one example of successful collaboration that is on the top of people's minds is the cooperation we had with other parties during the Phala Phala matter. We, collectively as opposition parties, forced the President to answer to Parliament when he did not want to. Secondly, we pushed for a sitting on the President’s impeachment and voted despite the concerted pushback by the ANC. We've also worked together with other opposition parties to expose how there was a predetermined outcome on the Public Protector matter. We collaborated with other parties to really get to the bottom of that matter during the Section 194 Inquiry and exposed how the majority party was not operating in a manner that was lawful and in the interest of South Africa. </p>
    <p><strong>There has been criticism that parliamentary administrations are becoming more partisan and losing the unique cooperation among party benches seen in the earlier parliaments - is this true?</strong></p>
    <p>Yes, indeed, that's the truth. This is because you find that there are many instances whereby there would be clear issues that are in the best interest of the country, and the ruling party shoots down well-meaning proposals because they have the power to do so. For example, the ANC has shot down some of the proposals by opposition parties, to establish inquiries on important matters simply because it wanted to maintain its partisan standing on a certain issue. So, there's been some collaboration within opposition parties, but when it comes to all of the parties in Parliament coming together, it has not translated into tangible actions. I remember when Uyinene Mrwetyana was brutally murdered in 2019, everyone agreed about the need for tough action. However, it only ended up in speeches instead of real, fundamental changes in our crime-fighting and the justice system. So in the ATM’s view, when there is cooperation among parties, it is just mere talk and does not translate into tangible action.</p>
    <p>Tell us more about how Parliament supports smaller parties. Is this support adequate and if not, what more could be done? </p>
    <p><strong>There's no different support that is given to the so-called smaller parties in our experience. Parliament avails resources proportionately to all represented parties. Smaller parties also have access to utilize Parliament’s researchers and content advisors assigned to each committee. So there is no difference in that aspect. However, the only other issue that could perhaps be a recommendation to Parliament is that researchers and support staff be assigned to individual MPs. This would give individual MPs the results they need for all their parliamentary programs and work unlike now, whereby the researchers either belong to a committee or parties. When they belong to your party they are sometimes unavailable as they would have other party-related commitments outside Parliament, and that disadvantages MPs. </strong></p>
    <p><strong>What advice would you give to other emerging small parties or independent candidates looking to impact parliamentary politics?</strong></p>
    <p>They need to stay true to the people. If they are the single lone voice fighting for justice and people’s interests, they should avoid being swallowed up by the system. It is easy to find oneself taking a view simply because the majority of the parties are of that very same view. However, this herd mentality will make these emerging parties or independent candidates lose the faith and the trust of the people. People want the truth. So that is maybe the most important advice.</p>
    <p><strong>What were your party's most significant achievements during the Sixth Parliament?</strong></p>
    <p>Let me start by dealing with bread-and-butter issues. Parliament’s mandates include lawmaking and oversight. MPs ought to make laws for the benefit of the public and carry out oversight to curb the abuse of power by the President and Ministers. On the legislative front, the ATM was successful in bringing to the fore the huge challenge of illegal immigration and of South Africans being undermined and dislodged from participating in the economy. This matter was subsequently taken up by Home Affairs Minister Motsoaledi through the drafting of relevant legislation as required of him by the Constitution. We've also led the call for more stringent inspection of businesses and SMEs by the Ministry of Small Business Development such that Minister Stella Abrahams confirmed that they were going to deploy more inspectors to ensure businesses trade in line with the law. This was the ATM’s proposal. Similarly, we pushed the Minister of Employment and Labour to equally hold businesses accountable for breaking the law by employing illegal immigrants. We also led the call to bring the President to account on the Phala Phala matter. Even though this matter has not yet been concluded as it is still before the courts, it is the ATM that led the call for parliamentary debates and discussions on it. These are just a few examples of our successes as the ATM this term.</p>
    <p><strong>What were the major challenges your party faced during the Sixth Parliament, and how did your party navigate and address these challenges? (incl the impact of COVID?)</strong></p>
    <p>For us, it was the ability to adapt and to find new ways of working during COVID-19. This was critical as we needed to find other creative ways of serving our constituents. The ability to adapt during challenging times is critical. Secondly, I think the need for consistency as an MP in fighting for what you believe in, and what is in the best interests of the people. So whatever happens you can come back to that party, to that point of view and be consistent in it.</p>
    <p><strong>Can you provide a glimpse into the party's priorities and focus for the Seventh Parliament?</strong></p>
    <p>From a legislative point of view, our priority would be to push for regulation of the film and television industry. We are currently drafting the bill to be introduced at the beginning of the Seventh Parliament. On societal issues, there are several priorities at the top of our heads. These include unemployment, poverty, inequality, crime and the general well-being of South Africans. Also, the question of spirituality is another priority. It is our view that South Africa is losing its way because leadership within society is not founded or anchored on a higher power. Spirituality should be a guiding principle and must take centre stage in what we do as leaders in Parliament and beyond, to maintain the societal fabric. The spirit of Ubuntu should not just be a phrase. Leaders should put people’s interests at the forefront and address all the wrongs currently happening in our country. Basically we need to give life and expression to Ubuntu by being practical about it and making spirituality lead our affairs. </p>
